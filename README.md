# Devin's crowmart
Simple client side VanillaJS. It can be tested by opening `index.html` in a browser window.

Added the `js` folder and contents
- `index.js` handles initializing the cart and sessionInfo. As well as handles sending the appropriate params to the API. Added to all pages.
- `cart.js` loads cart info from `localStorage` and displays the cart information on `cart.html`
- `addToCart.js` handles appending items to the `localStorage` cart and is used on both `crows.html` and `accessories.html`
